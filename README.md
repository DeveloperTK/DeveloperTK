My name is Christian and I am a Computer Science student at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). I've been developing small apps and services for a few years now and am looking forward to contributing more to the open-source world in the future.

If you would like to countribute to my projects feel free to create an issue or a pull request on any of my active projects. I will read through all of them and include your suggestions ðŸ˜‡

For now, why don't you check out some of my recent work ðŸ˜‰
